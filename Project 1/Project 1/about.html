	<p>This website is dedicated to some of the greatest crime films. Crime films have been one of the most popular genres of films. The earliest crime movies can be traced back to the late 1800 to early 1900, due to immigration and urbanization, organized crime, social anarchy and distrust of the government had increased. The alarming rate of increase in crime created a leeway for the emergence of crime movies. </p>
		<p>Crime movies have shaped how we view heroism, they also keep us in touch with our past and how it has reshaped our opinions and thoughts on differnt topics such as criminal responsibility, why people commit crime and etc. I have always been interested in criminal movies due to the fact people can admire this genre no matter where they are from. There are hundreds of crime movies however in this website I wanted to highlight movies that have shaped this genre and have inspired some of the greatest movies in present and will in the future. </p>

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Once upon a time,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
looks like she's gonna turn cold

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
tomorrow, yeah.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
You got that right. There was a salesman
called Jerry Lundegaard. Okay, real good.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Who always dreamt of striking it rich.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Wait, have you had a chance to think
about that deal I was talking about,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
those 40 acres there?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
And why is that, Jerry?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
We're not going to just give you $750,000.
No, no, but see...

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
So, we all set on this thing? Then you
want your own wife kidnapped?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Now, her dad, he's real well off, so why
don't you just ask him for the money?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
On Wade, it's Jerry. I don't know what to
do, it's something terrible.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
But in a place called Fargo.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Mr. Lundegaard?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm a police officer from Brainerd
investigating some malfeasance.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
How's Gene?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
My wife.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
All due respect, Jerry, I don't want you
mucking this up.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
Here's the second one. I want you to tell
me what these fellas look like.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, the little guy, he was kind of funny
looking.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Can you be any more specific?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
He wasn't circumcised. Jeez, I'm
cooperating here.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
And there. There's no... and...

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
What do you fellas got yourself mixed up in?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Oh, jeez.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
You're there in 30 minutes.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Where I find you and I shoot you and I
shoot your wife and I show you little children.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
You should see the other guy. Oh, jeez.

01:59.000 --> 02:08.000
Fargo.

02:08.000 --> 02:08.999
End of story.
